Evaluation of models uses a combination of measures of model fit (how the model does against the training data) and how it works on the test data.

# Key model measures

## Regression
You have one or two samples and a hypothesis, which may be true or false:

- The null hypothesis is that nothing happened.
- The alternative hypothesis is that something did happen.

Let’s say that you set out to prove that something did happen:
- You would look at the distribution of the data.
- You would choose a test statistic.
- You would look at the p-value.

You calculate a test statistic. It is critical that you know the distribution of the statistic. For a sample mean, you know the distribution by invoking the central limit theorem. From the statistic and its distribution, you can calculate the p-value. This is the probability of the test statistic value being so extreme that it supports the null hypothesis. If the p-value is too small, you can assume that the null hypothesis is false. This is called rejecting the null hypothesis.

### How small is too small?
How do you know when the p-value is small?
- When the p-value is greater than 0.05, the null hypothesis is true.
- When the p-value is less than 0.05, the alternative hypothesis is true.

For questions where it is important that you minimize the risk of the prediction being wrong, you may want the p-value to be 0.01 or even 0.001.

### Confidence intervals
What you need to consider is how confident you are that you can extrapolate from your little dataset to the larger population.
One way to establish this is to look at the mean. You can use descriptive statistics in Machine Learning to work out how much you can extrapolate from a small amount of data to a larger amount of data.

You can calculate relative frequency:
- How much is above or below the mean?
- Mean (after > before)
- Mean (abs(x – mean)) < 2 × sd(s) 

This gives you the fraction of data that is greater than two standard deviations from the mean.

How do statistics answer your questions?
- You can use the F statistic to determine whether your model is significant or insignificant.
- You can use the R2 statistic to determine the quality of the model and how well the data points fit the model.
- You can use P, or probability, to determine the likelihood that you are correct.

|	Type of analysis|	Test statistic|	How can you tell if it is significant? |	What assumption can you make?|
|------|-----|-----|------|
|	Regression analysis	|F	|Big F, small p (less than 0.05)|	A general relationship between the predictors and the response.|
|	Regression analysis	|t	| Big t (more than+2.0 or less than –2.0), small p (less than 0.05)	| X is an important predictor|
|	Difference of means	| t (two-tailed)|	Big t (more than +2.0 or less than –2.0), small p (less than 0.05)	|There is a significant difference of means.|
|	Difference of means	| t (one-tailed) |	Big t (more than +2.0 or less than –2.0), small p (less than 0.05)|	There is a significant difference of means.|

The p-value is a probability that this finding is significant. The lower the p-value, the better. You can look at the levels of significance, which are codes to help you identify the most appropriate level of p-value.

### The R2 statistic
R2 is the coefficient of determination. If you want to know how successful the model is, you look at this value. The higher the R2 value, the better. The variance of y is explained by the regression model, but the remaining variance is not explained by the model. The adjusted value takes into account the number of variables in the model.

R2 does not indicate whether:

- The independent variables are a cause of the changes in the dependent variable.
- Omitted-variable bias exists.
- The correct regression was used.
- The most appropriate set of independent variables has been chosen.
- There is collinearity present in the data on the explanatory variables.
- The model might be improved by using transformed versions of the existing set of independent variables.
- There are enough data points to make a solid conclusion.

### The F statistic
This is where the F statistic comes in. Its purpose is to determine whether the model is significant or insignificant. You should check the F statistic first because if it is not significant, the model doesn’t matter. 


### Metrics for regression models
Several other regression model metrics are calculated on the error in the model, which is the difference between the true value and the predicted value for each case:

- **Mean absolute error** The mean (average) of all the error in the model.
- **Root-mean-square error** The square root of the mean of the squares of all the errors in the model.
- **Relative absolute error** The total error in the model as a percentage of the total true value.
- **Relative square error** The square of the total error in the model, divided by the square of the total predicted values.
- **Coefficient of determination** The fit of the data to the model, expressed as a number between 1 (meaning that the data and model match exactly) and 0 (meaning that there is no match between the data and the model). It is often referred to as r2, R2, or r-squared.

## Classification
Some key metrics you might look at for classification models are:

- **Accuracy** True results as a proportion of total cases.
- **Precision** True results as a proportion of positive results.
- **Recall** Correct results as a fraction of all results.
- **F-score** A calculated combination of recall and precision.
- **AUC** For the area under the curve metric, the results are plotted as a curve on a graph, with false positives on the x-axis and true positives on the y-axis. AUC represents the area of the graph under the plotted curve.
- **Average log loss** The difference between the true probability distribution and the model’s probability distribution.
- **Train log loss** The difference between the prediction generated by the model against a random prediction.
